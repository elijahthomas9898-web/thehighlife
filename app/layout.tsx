 * Both are plain attributes driving CSS, so React never has to reconcile them.

 * ⚠️ The age gate's verified flag is rendered SERVER-SIDE, on purpose.

 * It used to rely solely on the boot script setting data-age="ok" on <html>.

 * even though the cookie, localStorage AND referrer all survived — React drops
 * DOM attributes it doesn't own when it re-renders the tree at startup, so the
 * gate reappeared on every page load and every refresh (mobile only).
 *
 * Reading the cookie here makes data-age a real React prop: it's in the HTML on
 * the very first byte (no flash, no JS required) and survives any re-render.
 * Cost: routes render dynamically instead of static. Worth it — a gate that
 * re-prompts every page is far more expensive than a server render.

          ProteusShop creates the JSCart <script> inside a useEffect, so the browser
          doesn't even learn cart.proteus420.com exists until our JS has downloaded,
          parsed and hydrated — and only THEN does it start a DNS lookup and TLS
          handshake for a ~570KB script. That's a long serial chain on a phone.

          preconnect does the DNS + TCP + TLS up front, in parallel with our own
          bundle, so the moment the effect runs the connection is already open.
          Costs a few bytes of HTML and no requests.

          The other three are hosts JSCart itself reaches for once it boots:
          Font Awesome (~100KB) and the two image hosts serving product artwork.
